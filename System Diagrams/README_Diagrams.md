# ChatGPT-like Project Diagrams

This document contains comprehensive diagrams for a ChatGPT-like application built with React/Next.js frontend, Ollama backend, and deployed on Vercel.

## Project Overview

The project is a web-based chat application that:
- Provides a ChatGPT-like interface for users to interact with AI
- Uses Ollama for local AI model execution
- Deployed on Vercel for global accessibility
- Supports multiple AI models (Llama 2, CodeLlama, Mistral, etc.)
- Includes conversation history and user preferences

## Diagrams Included

### 1. Class Diagram (`class_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows the object-oriented structure of the application
**Key Components**:
- Frontend classes (ChatInterface, Message, MessageComponent, etc.)
- Backend classes (ChatController, OllamaService, Model, etc.)
- Utility classes (ApiClient, ConfigManager, ErrorHandler)
- Relationships between all classes

### 2. Sequence Diagram (`sequence_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Illustrates the flow of interactions between components during a chat session
**Key Flows**:
- User sending a message
- API processing and Ollama integration
- Response generation and display
- Error handling scenarios
- Chat history management

### 3. Use Case Diagram (`use_case_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows different actors and their interactions with the system
**Actors**:
- User (send messages, view history, manage conversations)
- Developer (manage models, monitor performance, deploy)
- Ollama Service (process language, generate responses)

### 4. Activity Diagram (`activity_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows the step-by-step workflow of the chat application
**Key Activities**:
- Application initialization
- Message processing workflow
- Error handling flows
- User interaction patterns

### 5. Component Diagram (`component_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Displays the high-level architecture and component relationships
**Key Components**:
- Frontend packages (React components, theme management)
- API Layer (routes, middleware, error handling)
- Business Logic (controllers, processors)
- External Services (Ollama, local AI models)
- Deployment infrastructure (Vercel Edge Functions)

### 6. Deployment Diagram (`deployment_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows how the application is deployed across different environments
**Key Deployments**:
- User's local machine (browser + Ollama)
- Vercel cloud platform (edge functions, CDN)
- Developer machine (development environment)
- External services (GitHub, NPM)

### 7. Flowchart (`flowchart.puml`)
**Purpose**: Provides a detailed process flow of the application
**Key Processes**:
- Application startup and initialization
- User interaction loops
- Chat processing workflow
- Conversation management
- Settings and preferences handling

### 8. ER Diagram (`er_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows the data model and relationships between entities
**Key Entities**:
- User, Conversation, Message
- Model, Session, UserPreferences
- ChatHistory, ErrorLog, ModelUsage
- Complete relationship mapping

### 9. Network Diagram (`network_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Illustrates the network architecture and connections
**Key Networks**:
- User's local network (browser, Ollama service)
- Vercel Edge Network (global CDN)
- Developer network connections
- External service integrations

### 10. State Diagram (`state_diagram.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows the different states of the application and state transitions
**Key States**:
- Loading, Ready, Processing
- Error states and recovery
- Maintenance and cleanup states
- User interaction states

## How to Use These Diagrams

### Prerequisites
1. Install PlantUML for rendering diagrams
2. Use PlantUML extensions in your IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
3. Or use online PlantUML editors

### Rendering Diagrams
1. Open any `.puml` file in a PlantUML-compatible editor
2. The diagrams will render automatically
3. Export as PNG, SVG, or PDF as needed

### Understanding the Architecture
1. Start with the **Component Diagram** for high-level overview
2. Review the **Deployment Diagram** for infrastructure understanding
3. Use the **Class Diagram** for detailed code structure
4. Follow the **Sequence Diagram** for interaction flows
5. Check the **ER Diagram** for data relationships

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React/Next.js
- **UI Components**: Custom chat interface components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Styling**: CSS modules or styled-components
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for chat history

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **AI Service**: Ollama (local AI model server)
- **Models**: Llama 2, CodeLlama, Mistral, etc.
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel integration
- **Local AI**: Ollama running on user's machine

## Key Features Covered

1. **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging interface
2. **AI Integration**: Local AI model processing via Ollama
3. **Conversation History**: Persistent chat storage
4. **Multi-model Support**: Different AI models available
5. **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode
6. **Export Functionality**: Chat export capabilities
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
8. **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop support
9. **Performance Monitoring**: Usage tracking and analytics
